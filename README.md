# Hi there!! ðŸ‘‹
## I'm Tristin,
* a young technology teen from the USA. I've been in the tech world since 2019, when my dad brought home a Raspberry PI 3, of which I still have to this day. Since receiving that PI 3, I've expanded my knowledge, taking almost every local opportunity I can. I have basic knowledge of Linux, Windows, computer components, Network engineering, and can read most code and make sense of it. I have my own home lab for general testing, composed of a Dell T8510, Raspberry PI 5, Netgear Network Switch and access point. Learn more about my home lab at my youtube channel.
